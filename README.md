## Description 

This is a social networking API program that utilizes MongoDB, Node.js, and Mongoose to create the basic functionality of users interacting with a social networking platform. The acceptance criteria includes CRUD operations for users and their thoughts. You can also create a friend or react to an existing thought. In addition to basic validation, you will also see some virtuals that count the number of friends or thought reactions. Since there is not a corresponding UI for this API, please watch the walkthrough video(s) to get a more detailed description of the program.
